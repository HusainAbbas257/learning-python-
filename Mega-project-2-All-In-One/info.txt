Unlike other Mega projects that i did i will commit it daily and write each commit here:
    1.Started new Mega Project: All In One,made info.txt
    2.built main.py to display the actual screen of the app and options that can be utilised.
    3.started with tools and built calculator.py
    4.Made two games : number guessing,rock paper scissor
    5.made 2 tools:unit_converter.py and password_manager.py
    6.made a cool simulation program and a mad-libs that answers in strange fun stories.(after a long time i am commiting)
